  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Predicting seizure likelihood for the following day
              would enable clinicians to extend or potentially schedule
              video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring when seizure risk
              is high. Combining standardized clinical data with short-term
              recordings of wearables to predict seizure likelihood could have
              high practical relevance as wearable data is easy and fast to
              collect. As a first step toward seizure forecasting, we
              classified patients based on whether they had seizures or not
              during the following recording. METHODS: Pediatric patients
              admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit wore a wearable that
              recorded the heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV),
              electrodermal activity (EDA), and peripheral body temperature. We
              utilized short recordings from 9:00 to 9:15 pm and compared mean
              values between patients with and without impending seizures. In
              addition, we collected clinical data: age, sex, age at first
              seizure, generalized slowing, focal slowing, and spikes on EEG,
              magnetic resonance imaging findings, and antiseizure medication
              reduction. We used conventional machine learning techniques with
              cross-validation to classify patients with and without impending
              seizures. RESULTS: We included 139 patients: 78 had no seizures
              and 61 had at least one seizure after 9 pm during the concurrent
              video-EEG and E4 recordings. HR (P < 0.01) and EDA (P < 0.01)
              were lower and HRV (P = 0.02) was higher for patients with than
              for patients without impending seizures. The average accuracy of
              group classification was 66\%, and the mean area under the
              receiver operating characteristics was 0.72. CONCLUSIONS:
              Short-term wearable recordings in combination with clinical data
              have great potential as an easy-to-use seizure likelihood
              assessment tool.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: Seizure forecasting may provide patients with timely
               warnings to adapt their daily activities and help clinicians
               deliver more objective, personalized treatments. Although recent
               work has convincingly demonstrated that seizure risk assessment
               is in principle possible, these early approaches relied largely
               on complex, often invasive setups including intracranial
               electrocorticography, implanted devices, and multichannel
               electroencephalography, and required patient-specific adaptation
               or learning to perform optimally, all of which limit translation
               to broad clinical application. To facilitate broader adaptation
               of seizure forecasting in clinical practice, noninvasive, easily
               applicable techniques that reliably assess seizure risk without
               much prior tuning are crucial. Wristbands that continuously
               record physiological parameters, including electrodermal
               activity, body temperature, blood volume pulse, and actigraphy,
               may afford monitoring of autonomous nervous system function and
               movement relevant for such a task, hence minimizing potential
               complications associated with invasive monitoring and avoiding
               stigma associated with bulky external monitoring devices on the
               head. METHODS: Here, we applied deep learning on multimodal
               wristband sensor data from 69 patients with epilepsy (total
               duration > 2311 hours, 452 seizures) to assess its capability to
               forecast seizures in a statistically significant way. RESULTS:
               Using a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation approach, we
               identified better-than-chance predictability in 43\% of the
               patients. Time-matched seizure surrogate data analyses indicated
               forecasting not to be driven simply by time of day or vigilance
               state. Prediction performance peaked when all sensor modalities
               were used, and did not differ between generalized and focal
               seizure types, but generally increased with the size of the
               training dataset, indicating potential further improvement with
               larger datasets in the future. SIGNIFICANCE: Collectively, these
               results show that statistically significant seizure risk
               assessments are feasible from easy-to-use, noninvasive wearable

               the widely used electroencephalographic (EEG) systems for
               monitoring epileptic seizures. Using custom-developed
               deep-learning seizure detection models, we demonstrate the
               detection of a broad range of seizure types by wearable signals.
               METHODS: Patients admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit were
               enrolled and asked to wear wearable sensors on either wrists or
               ankles. We collected patients' electrodermal activity,
               accelerometry (ACC), and photoplethysmography, from which blood
               volume pulse (BVP) is derived. Board-certified epileptologists
               determined seizure onset, offset, and types using video and EEG
               recordings per the International League Against Epilepsy 2017
               classification. We applied three neural network models-a
               convolutional neural network (CNN) and a CNN-long short-term
               memory (LSTM)-based generalized detection model and an
               autoencoder-based personalized detection model-to the raw
               time-series sensor data to detect seizures and utilized
               performance measures, including sensitivity, false positive rate
               (the number of false alarms divided by the total number of
               nonseizure segments), number of false alarms per day, and
               detection delay. We applied a 10-fold patientwise
               cross-validation scheme to the multisignal biosensor data and
               evaluated model performance on 28 seizure types. RESULTS: We
               analyzed 166 patients (47.6\% female, median age = 10.0 years)
               and 900 seizures (13 254 h of sensor data) for 28 seizure types.
               With a CNN-LSTM-based seizure detection model, ACC, BVP, and
               their fusion performed better than chance; ACC and BVP data
               fusion reached the best detection performance of 83.9\%
               sensitivity and 35.3\% false positive rate. Nineteen of 28

              biosignal characteristics of overall and various seizure types as

              devices (Empatica E4); develop predictive models for overall and
              each seizure type; and assess diagnostic performance of each
              model. METHODS: We prospectively recruited patients with focal
              epilepsy who were admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for
              presurgical evaluation during January to December 2020. All study
              participants were simultaneously applied gold standard long-term
              video-electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring and an index test,
              E4. Two certified epileptologists independently determined
              whether captured events were seizures and then indicated ictal
              semiology and EEG information. Both were blind to multimodal
              biosignal findings detected by E4. Biosignals during 5-min epochs
              of both seizure events and baseline were collected and compared.
              Predictive models for occurrence overall and of each seizure type
              were developed using a generalized estimating equation.
              Diagnostic performance of each model was then assessed. RESULTS:
              Thirty patients had events recorded and were recruited for
              analysis. One hundred eight seizure events and 120 baseline
              epochs were collected. Heart rate (HR), acceleration (ACC), and
              electrodermal activity (EDA) but not temperature were
              significantly elevated during seizures. Cluster analysis showed
              trends of greatest elevation of HR and ACC in bilateral
              tonic-clonic seizures (BTCs), as compared with non-BTCs and
              isolated auras. HR and ACC were independent predictors for
              overall seizure types, BTCs, and non-BTCs, whereas only HR was a
              predictor for isolated aura. Diagnostic performance including
              sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating
              characteristic (ROC) curve of the predictive model for overall
              seizures were 77.78\%, 60\%, and .696 (95\% confidence interval =
              .628-.764), respectively. SIGNIFICANCE: Multimodal extracerebral
              biosignals (HR, ACC, EDA) detected by a wrist-worn smartwatch can
              help differentiate between epileptic seizures and normal physical
              activities. It would be worthwhile to implement our predictive

               mean age 36.17 yrs), five of whom had a total of seven seizures.
               Patients were monitored in an inpatient setting using standard
               video-electroencephalography (vEEG), while also wearing sensors
               monitoring electrocardiography, electrodermal activity,
               electromyography, accelerometry, and audio signals
               (vocalizations). A systematic and detailed study was conducted
               to identify the sensors and the features derived from the
               non-cerebral sensors that contribute most significantly to
               separability of data acquired during seizures from non-seizure
               data. Post-processing of the data using linear discriminant
               analysis (LDA) shows that seizure data are strongly separable
               from non-seizure data based on features derived from the signals

               experienced a seizure during data collection, calculated using
               LDA, was 0.9682. The features that contribute most significantly

               separability. Development of a non-electroencephalography (EEG)

  abstract  = "Wearable automated seizure detection devices offer a high
               potential to improve seizure management, through continuous
               ambulatory monitoring, accurate seizure counts, and real-time
               alerts for prompt intervention. More importantly, these devices
               can be a life-saving help for people with a higher risk of
               sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), especially in case
               of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS). The Embrace and E4
               wristbands (Empatica) are the first commercially available
               multimodal wristbands that were designed to sense the
               physiological hallmarks of ongoing GTCS: while Embrace only
               embeds a machine learning-based detection algorithm, both E4 and
               Embrace devices are equipped with motion (accelerometers, ACC)
               and electrodermal activity (EDA) sensors and both the devices
               received medical clearance (E4 from EU CE, Embrace from EU CE
               and US FDA). The aim of this contribution is to provide updated
               evidence of the effectiveness of GTCS detection and monitoring
               relying on the combination of ACM and EDA sensors. A machine
               learning algorithm able to recognize ACC and EDA signatures of
               GTCS-like events has been developed on E4 data, labeled using
               gold-standard video-EEG examined by epileptologists in clinical
               centers, and has undergone continuous improvement. While keeping
               an elevated sensitivity to GTCS (92-100\%), algorithm
               improvements and growing data availability led to lower false
               alarm rate (FAR) from the initial Ëœ2 down to 0.2-1 false alarms
               per day, as showed by retrospective and prospective analyses in
               inpatient settings. Algorithm adjustment to better discriminate
               real-life physical activities from GTCS, has brought the initial
               FAR of Ëœ6 on outpatient real life settings, down to values
               comparable to best-case clinical settings (FAR < 0.5), with
               comparable sensitivity. Moreover, using multimodal sensing, it
               has been possible not only to detect GTCS but also to quantify
               seizure-induced autonomic dysfunction, based on automatic
               features of abnormal motion and EDA. The latter biosignal
               correlates with the duration of post-ictal generalized EEG
               suppression, a biomarker observed in 100\% of monitored SUDEP

               seizure detection using cardiac and activity features to detect
               a wide range of seizures across different people using the same
               model. METHODS: Electrocardiogram (ECG) and accelerometer data
               were collected from a chest-worn sensor from 62 children aged
               2-17 years undergoing video-electroencephalogram monitoring for
               clinical care. ECG data from 5 adults aged 31-48 years who
               experienced focal seizures were also analyzed from the PhysioNet
               database. A detection algorithm was developed based on a
               combination of multiple heart rhythm and motion parameters.
               RESULTS: Excluding patients with multiple seizures per hour and
               myoclonic jerks, 25 seizures were captured from 18 children.
               Using cardiac parameters only, 11/12 generalized seizures with
               clonic or tonic activity were detected as well as 7/13 focal
               seizures without generalization. Separately, cardiac parameters
               were evaluated using electrocardiogram data from 10 complex
               partial seizures in the PhysioNet database of which 7 were
               detected. False alarms averaged one per day. Movement-based
               parameters did not identify any seizures missed by cardiac
               parameters, but did improve detection time for 4 of the
               generalized seizures. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that cardiac
               measures can detect seizures with bilateral motor features with
               high sensitivity, while detection of focal seizures depends on
               seizure duration and localization and may require customization

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Video electroencephalography recordings, routinely
               used in epilepsy monitoring units, are the gold standard for
               monitoring epileptic seizures. However, monitoring is also
               needed in the day-to-day lives of people with epilepsy, where
               video electroencephalography is not feasible. Wearables could
               fill this gap by providing patients with an accurate log of
               their seizures. OBJECTIVE: Although there are already systems
               available that provide promising results for the detection of
               tonic-clonic seizures (TCSs), research in this area is often
               limited to detection from 1 biosignal modality or only during
               the night when the patient is in bed. The aim of this study is
               to provide evidence that supervised machine learning can detect
               TCSs from multimodal data in a new data set during daytime and
               nighttime. METHODS: An extensive data set of biosignals from a
               multimodal watch worn by people with epilepsy was recorded
               during their stay in the epilepsy monitoring unit at 2 European
               clinical sites. From a larger data set of 243 enrolled
               participants, those who had data recorded during TCSs were
               selected, amounting to 10 participants with 21 TCSs.
               Accelerometry and electrodermal activity recorded by the
               wearable device were used for analysis, and seizure
               manifestation was annotated in detail by clinical experts. Ten
               accelerometry and 3 electrodermal activity features were
               calculated for sliding windows of variable size across the data.
               A gradient tree boosting algorithm was used for seizure
               detection, and the optimal parameter combination was determined
               in a leave-one-participant-out cross-validation on a training
               set of 10 seizures from 8 participants. The model was then
               evaluated on an out-of-sample test set of 11 seizures from the
               remaining 2 participants. To assess specificity, we additionally
               analyzed data from up to 29 participants without TCSs during the
               model evaluation. RESULTS: In the leave-one-participant-out
               cross-validation, the model optimized for sensitivity could
               detect all 10 seizures with a false alarm rate of 0.46 per day
               in 17.3 days of data. In a test set of 11 out-of-sample TCSs,
               amounting to 8.3 days of data, the model could detect 10
               seizures and produced no false positives. Increasing the test
               set to include data from 28 more participants without additional
               TCSs resulted in a false alarm rate of 0.19 per day in 78 days
               of wearable data. CONCLUSIONS: We show that a gradient tree
               boosting machine can robustly detect TCSs from multimodal
               wearable data in an original data set and that even with very
               limited training data, supervised machine learning can achieve a
               high sensitivity and low false-positive rate. This methodology
               may offer a promising way to approach wearable-based
               nonconvulsive seizure detection.",

               challenging to detect and effectively treat this disorder. The
               seizures are random, and most epileptic patients experience
               dangerous physical symptoms during an attack that renders the
               patient uneasy when conducting their daily tasks. This paper
               focuses on the generalised type of epilepsy, namely ``Grand mal

               monitor symptoms of epileptic disease behaviour signals in
               humans and prevent it at its early stage of illness. To achieve
               this objective, we used the Electrocardiogram (ECG),
               Electromyography (EMG), accelerometer 3-axes for fall detection,
               and Dallas sensor for body temperature signals monitoring for
               updating the IoT system. The fuzzy logic algorithm that has been
               used to assess specified data set of diseased patients'
               parameters allows the classification into diverse types of
               seizures such as heart rate, body temperature, muscles spasm and
               falls. These are used as inputs to obtain the seizure type as an

               multimodal wearable device (IMEC) aimed at seizure detection
               while admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit. Seizures were
               labelled by a neurologist and start and offset time were noted.
               The signals captured by the device during the seizure window
               were plotted and a visual inspection was performed for focal
               motor seizures with impaired awareness and for focal motor aware
               seizures. RESULTS: Fifty-three seizures from twelve patients
               with focal seizures with motor manifestations recorded with the
               device were visually inspected. Overall, a common pattern
               presented across focal motor seizures with impaired awareness
               and it was characterized by early cardiac manifestations
               followed by motor phenomena and final EDA response. Motor
               seizures with retained awareness appeared to be characterized by
               brief motor events not associated with major autonomic
               manifestations Conclusion: an overall common digital phenotype
               and time-evolution pattern was demonstrated for focal motor
               seizures with impaired awareness. The identification of the
               evolution pattern could more precisely inform the development of
               highly preforming algorithms opening the possibility to a more
               precise, and potentially customizable way to optimize focal
               seizure detection.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to develop and evaluate a
               machine learning-based algorithm for the detection of focal to
               bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (FBTCS) using a novel multimodal
               connected shirt. METHODS: We prospectively recruited patients
               with epilepsy admitted to our epilepsy monitoring unit and asked
               them to wear the connected shirt while under simultaneous
               video-electroencephalographic monitoring. Electrocardiographic
               (ECG) and accelerometric (ACC) signals recorded with the
               connected shirt were used for the development of the seizure
               detection algorithm. First, we used a sliding window to extract
               linear and nonlinear features from both ECG and ACC signals.
               Then, we trained an extreme gradient boosting algorithm
               (XGBoost) to detect FBTCS according to seizure onset and offset
               annotated by three board-certified epileptologists. Finally, we
               applied a postprocessing step to regularize the classification
               output. A patientwise nested cross-validation was implemented to
               evaluate the performances in terms of sensitivity, false alarm
               rate (FAR), time in false warning (TiW), detection latency, and
               receiver operating characteristic area under the curve
               (ROC-AUC). RESULTS: We recorded 66 FBTCS from 42 patients who
               wore the connected shirt for a total of 8067 continuous hours.
               The XGBoost algorithm reached a sensitivity of 84.8\% (56/66
               seizures), with a median FAR of .55/24 h and a median TiW of 10
               s/alarm. ROC-AUC was .90 (95\% confidence interval = .88-.91).
               Median detection latency from the time of progression to the
               bilateral tonic-clonic phase was 25.5 s. SIGNIFICANCE: The novel
               connected shirt allowed accurate detection of FBTCS with a low
               false alarm rate in a hospital setting. Prospective studies in a
               residential setting with a real-time and online seizure
               detection algorithm are required to validate the performance and

  abstract  = "Objective. The detection of seizures using wearable devices
               would improve epilepsy management, but reliable detection of
               seizures in an ambulatory environment remains challenging, and
               current studies lack concurrent validation of seizures using
               electroencephalography (EEG) data.Approach. An adaptively
               trained long-short-term memory deep neural network was developed
               and trained using a modest number of seizure data sets from
               wrist-worn devices. Transfer learning was used to adapt a
               classifier that was initially trained on intracranial
               electroencephalography (iEEG) signals to facilitate
               classification of non-EEG physiological datasets comprising
               accelerometry, blood volume pulse, skin electrodermal activity,
               heart rate, and temperature signals. The algorithm's performance
               was assessed with and without pre-training on iEEG signals and
               transfer learning. To assess the performance of the seizure
               detection classifier using long-term ambulatory data, wearable
               devices were used for multiple months with an implanted
               neurostimulator capable of recording iEEG signals, which
               provided independent electrographic seizure detections that were
               reviewed by a board-certified epileptologist.Main results. For
               19 motor seizures from 10 in-hospital patients, the algorithm
               yielded a mean area under curve (AUC), a sensitivity, and an
               false alarm rate per day (FAR/day) of 0.98, 0.93, and 2.3,
               respectively. Additionally, for eight seizures with probable
               motor semiology from two ambulatory patients, the classifier
               achieved a mean AUC of 0.97 and an FAR of 2.45 events/day at a
               sensitivity of 0.9. For all seizure types in the ambulatory
               setting, the classifier had a mean AUC of 0.82 with a
               sensitivity of 0.47 and an FAR of 7.2 events/day.Significance.
               The performance of the algorithm was evaluated using motor and
               non-motor seizures during in-hospital and ambulatory use. The
               classifier was able to detect multiple types of motor and

               Samsung watch (SM-R800), and evaluate its effectiveness for the
               detection of generalized convulsive seizures (GCS) in persons
               with epilepsy. METHODS: This multisite epilepsy monitoring unit
               (EMU) phase 2 study included 36 adult patients. Each patient
               wore a Samsung watch that contained accelerometer, gyroscope,
               and photoplethysmographic sensors. Sixty-eight time and
               frequency domain features were extracted from the sensor data
               and were used to train a random forest algorithm. A testing
               framework was developed that would better reflect the EMU
               setting, consisting of (1) leave-one-patient-out
               cross-validation (LOPO CV) on GCS patients, (2) false alarm rate
               (FAR) testing on nonseizure patients, and (3)
               ``fixed-and-frozen'' prospective testing on a prospective
               patient cohort. Balanced accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and
               FAR were used to quantify the performance of the algorithm.
               Seizure onsets and offsets were determined by using
               video-electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring. Feature
               importance was calculated as the mean decrease in Gini impurity
               during the LOPO CV testing. RESULTS: LOPO CV results showed
               balanced accuracy of .93 (95\% confidence interval [CI] =
               .8-.98), precision of .68 (95\% CI = .46-.85), sensitivity of
               .87 (95\% CI = .62-.96), and FAR of .21/24 h (interquartile
               range [IQR] = 0-.90). Testing the algorithm on patients without
               seizure resulted in an FAR of .28/24 h (IQR = 0-.61). During the
               ``fixed-and-frozen'' prospective testing, two patients had three
               GCS, which were detected by the algorithm, while generating an
               FAR of .25/24 h (IQR = 0-.89). Feature importance showed that
               heart rate-based features outperformed
               accelerometer/gyroscope-based features. SIGNIFICANCE:
               Commercially available wearable digital watches that reliably
               detect GCS, with minimum false alarm rates, may overcome usage
               adoption and other limitations of custom-built devices.
               Contingent on the outcomes of a prospective phase 3 study, such
               devices have the potential to provide non-EEG-based seizure
               surveillance and forecasting in the clinical setting.",

               METHODS: In this multicenter, in-home, prospective,
               video-controlled cohort study, nocturnal seizures were detected
               by heart rate (photoplethysmography) or movement (3-D
               accelerometry) in persons with epilepsy and intellectual
               disability. Participants with >1 monthly major seizure wore a
               bracelet (Nightwatch) on the upper arm at night for 2 to 3
               months. Major seizures were tonic-clonic, generalized tonic >30
               seconds, hyperkinetic, or others, including clusters (>30
               minutes) of short myoclonic/tonic seizures. The video of all
               events (alarms, nurse diaries) and 10\% completely screened
               nights were reviewed to classify major (needing an alarm), minor
               (needing no alarm), or no seizure. Reliability was tested by
               interobserver agreement. We determined device performance,
               compared it to a bed sensor (Emfit), and evaluated the
               caregivers' user experience. RESULTS: Twenty-eight of 34
               admitted participants (1,826 nights, 809 major seizures)
               completed the study. Interobserver agreement (major/no major
               seizures) was 0.77 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.65-0.89).
               Median sensitivity per participant amounted to 86\% (95\% CI

               (95\% CI 33\%-64\%). The multimodal sensor showed a better
               sensitivity than the bed sensor (n = 14, median difference 58\%,
               95\% CI 39\%-80\%, p < 0.001). The caregivers' questionnaire (n

               seizures from 15 patients (seven males, age 3-46 years, median =

               independent test dataset comprised nocturnal recordings,
               including 10 tonic seizures from three patients and additional
               (distractor) data from three subjects without seizures. The ANN

  abstract = "Our current understanding of human physiology and activities is
              largely derived from sparse and discrete individual clinical
              measurements. To achieve precise, proactive, and effective health
              management of an individual, longitudinal, and dense tracking of
              personal physiomes and activities is required, which is only
              feasible by utilizing wearable biosensors. As a pilot study, we
              implemented a cloud computing infrastructure to integrate
              wearable sensors, mobile computing, digital signal processing,
              and machine learning to improve early detection of seizure onsets
              in children. We recruited 99 children diagnosed with epilepsy and
              longitudinally tracked them at single-second resolution using a
              wearable wristband, and prospectively acquired more than one
              billion data points. This unique dataset offered us an
              opportunity to quantify physiological dynamics (e.g., heart rate,
              stress response) across age groups and to identify physiological
              irregularities upon epilepsy onset. The high-dimensional personal
              physiome and activity profiles displayed a clustering pattern
              anchored by patient age groups. These signatory patterns included
              strong age and sex-specific effects on varying circadian rhythms
              and stress responses across major childhood developmental stages.
              For each patient, we further compared the physiological and
              activity profiles associated with seizure onsets with the
              personal baseline and developed a machine learning framework to
              accurately capture these onset moments. The performance of this
              framework was further replicated in another independent patient
              cohort. We next referenced our predictions with the
              electroencephalogram (EEG) signals on selected patients and
              demonstrated that our approach could detect subtle seizures not
              recognized by humans and could detect seizures prior to clinical
              onset. Our work demonstrated the feasibility of a real-time
              mobile infrastructure in a clinical setting, which has the
              potential to be valuable in caring for epileptic patients.
              Extension of such a system has the potential to be leveraged as a
              health management device or longitudinal phenotyping tool in
              clinical cohort studies.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: Wearable devices are effective for detecting
               generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS). However, many daily
               activities are often misclassified as GTCS, leading to a decline
               in user confidence. This study recommends utilizing wristband
               three-axis accelerometer (ACC), three-axis gyroscope (GYRO), and
               surface electromyography (sEMG) signals for GTCS detection and
               presents a novel seizure detection algorithm that offers high
               sensitivity and a reduced false alarm rate (FAR). METHODS:
               Inpatients with epilepsy and out-of-hospital healthy subjects
               were recruited and required to wear a wristband device to
               collect wristband signals. The proposed algorithm comprises five
               steps: preprocessing, motion filtering, feature extraction,
               classification, and postprocessing. The variations in
               performance across different signal combinations were compared.
               Additionally, the impact of training the model using only
               inpatient data versus the complete dataset on the algorithm's
               performance was also investigated. RESULTS: Wristband signals
               were collected from 45 patients and 30 healthy subjects,
               encompassing a total of 3367.3 h and including 60 GTCS. The
               proposed algorithm achieved 100 \% sensitivity and a FAR of
               0.1070/24 h. It demonstrated higher sensitivity and lower FAR
               compared to combinations with fewer signal modalities. In
               addition, the model trained on only in-hospital data
               demonstrates high sensitivity (98.33 \%) and high FAR (0.9845/24
               h). SIGNIFICANCE: The algorithm proposed for detecting GTCS
               using wristband ACC, GYRO, and sEMG signals achieved encouraging
               results, demonstrating the feasibility of this signal
               combination. Furthermore, incorporating out-of-hospital data
               into model training proved to be an effective solution for
               reducing FAR, which could facilitate the clinical application of
               seizure detection algorithms.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: Tracking seizures is crucial for epilepsy monitoring
               and treatment evaluation. Current epilepsy care relies on
               caretaker seizure diaries, but clinical seizure monitoring may
               miss seizures. Wearable devices may be better tolerated and more
               suitable for long-term ambulatory monitoring. This study
               evaluates the seizure detection performance of custom-developed
               machine learning (ML) algorithms across a broad spectrum of
               epileptic seizures utilizing wrist- and ankle-worn multisignal
               biosensors. METHODS: We enrolled patients admitted to the
               epilepsy monitoring unit and asked them to wear a wearable
               sensor on either their wrists or ankles. The sensor recorded
               body temperature, electrodermal activity, accelerometry (ACC),
               and photoplethysmography, which provides blood volume pulse
               (BVP). We used electroencephalographic seizure onset and offset
               as determined by a board-certified epileptologist as a standard
               comparison. We trained and validated ML for two different
               algorithms: Algorithm 1, ML methods for developing seizure
               type-specific detection models for nine individual seizure
               types; and Algorithm 2, ML methods for building general seizure
               type-agnostic detection, lumping together all seizure types.
               RESULTS: We included 94 patients (57.4\% female, median age =
               9.9 years) and 548 epileptic seizures (11 066 h of sensor data)
               for a total of 930 seizures and nine seizure types. Algorithm 1
               detected eight of nine seizure types better than chance (area
               under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC-ROC] =
               .648-.976). Algorithm 2 detected all nine seizure types better
               than chance (AUC-ROC = .642-.995); a fusion of ACC and BVP
               modalities achieved the best AUC-ROC (.752) when combining all
               seizure types together. SIGNIFICANCE: Automatic seizure
               detection using ML from multimodal wearable sensor data is
               feasible across a broad spectrum of epileptic seizures.
               Preliminary results show better than chance seizure detection.
               The next steps include validation of our results in larger
               datasets, evaluation of the detection utility tool for
               additional clinical seizure types, and integration of additional
               clinical information.",

               attended when seizures strike. Consequently, there is a need for
               wearable devices capable of detecting both convulsive and
               nonconvulsive seizures in everyday life. We have developed a
               three-stage seizure detection methodology based on 339 h of data
               (26 seizures) collected from 10 patients in an epilepsy
               monitoring unit. Our intent is to develop a wearable system that
               will detect seizures, alert a caregiver and record the time of
               seizure in an electronic diary for the patient's physician.
               Stage I looks for concurrent activity in heart rate, arterial
               oxygenation and electrodermal activity, all of which can be
               monitored by a wrist-worn device and which in combination
               produce a very low false positive rate. Stage II looks for a
               specific pattern created by these three biosignals. For the
               patients whose seizures cannot be detected by Stage II, Stage
               III detects seizures using limited-channel electroencephalogram
               (EEG) monitoring with at most three electrodes. Out of 10
               patients, Stage I recognized all 11 seizures from seven
               patients, Stage II detected all 10 seizures from six patients
               and Stage III detected all of the seizures of two out of the
