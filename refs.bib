               of PPG has made it useful in both clinical and non-clinical
               applications. However, PPG-based heart rate tracking is a
               challenging problem due to motion artifacts (MAs) which are main

               measuring variations of blood perfusion in peripheral tissues.
               We evaluated alterations in PPG signals in relationship to the
               occurrence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCSs) in
               patients with epilepsy to evaluate the feasibility of seizure
               detection. METHODS: During electroencephalographic (EEG)
               long-term monitoring, patients wore portable wristband sensor(s)
               on their wrists or ankles recording PPG signals. We analyzed PPG
               signals during three time periods, which were defined with
               respect to seizures detected on EEG: (1) baseline (>30 minutes
               prior to seizure), (2) preseizure period, and (3) postseizure
               period. Furthermore, we selected five random control segments
               during seizure-free periods. PPG features, including frequency,
               amplitude, duration, slope, smoothness, and area under the
               curve, were automatically calculated. We used a linear
               mixed-effect model to evaluate changes in PPG features between
               different time periods in an attempt to identify signal changes
               that detect seizures. RESULTS: We prospectively enrolled 174
               patients from the epilepsy monitoring unit at Boston Children's
               Hospital. Twenty-five GTCSs were recorded from 13 patients. Data
               from the first recorded GTCS of each patient were included in
               the analysis. We observed an increase in PPG frequency during
               pre- and postseizure periods that was higher than the changes
               during seizure-free periods (frequency increase: preseizure =
               0.22 Hz, postseizure = 0.58 Hz vs changes during seizure-free
               period = 0.05 Hz). The PPG slope decreased significantly by
               56.71 nW/s during preseizure periods compared to seizure-free
               periods. Additionally, the smoothness increased significantly by
               0.22 nW/s during the postseizure period compared to seizure-free
               periods. SIGNIFICANCE: Monitoring of PPG signals may assist in
               the detection of GTCSs in patients with epilepsy. PPG may serve
               as a promising biomarker for future seizure detection systems
               and may contribute to future seizure prediction systems.",

               detection devices (SDDs) and their mechanisms of action and
               efficacy and to reflect on potential improvements for future
               devices. RECENT FINDINGS: There are 5 main categories of SDDs,
               these include EEG, heart rate detection (HR), electrodermal
               activity (EDA), motion detection, and EMG. These devices can be
               used in combination or in isolation to detect seizures. These
               devices are high in their sensitivity for convulsive seizures
               but are low in specificity because of a tendency to detect
               artifact. Overall, they perform poorly in identifying
               nonconvulsive seizures. SUMMARY: SDDs are currently most useful
               in detecting convulsive seizures and thereby might help against
               sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, although they have a high
               false positive rate. These devices are much less adept at
               detecting more clinically subtle seizures.",

               autonomic symptoms and signs during epileptic seizures. METHODS:
               We performed a systematic literature search on the following
               autonomic symptoms and signs during epileptic seizures:
               cardiovascular changes, respiratory manifestations,
               gastrointestinal symptoms, cutaneous manifestations, sexual and
               genital manifestations, and urinary symptoms. RESULTS: Autonomic
               symptoms and signs can represent the predominant symptom at the
               onset of a focal seizure, which would then lead to the seizure
               being classified as a focal onset autonomic seizure. Conversely,
               clinically relevant autonomic symptoms and signs frequently
               accompany seizures of focal, generalized, and/or unknown onset,
               but the seizure is regardless classified according to other,
               more relevant features. Autonomic symptoms and signs do not
               represent mere reactions to motor activity or other behavioral
               seizure manifestations, but rather they are generated by
               epileptic discharges affecting the central autonomic network. We
               have reviewed the localizing and lateralizing information
               currently available on the seizure onset zone and on seizure
               propagation pathways as provided by systematic analysis of
               specific autonomic seizure symptoms and signs. We present data
               on how autonomic seizure symptoms and signs are useful for
               gaining a better understanding of the anatomical and functional
               organization of the central autonomic network. Finally, we
               discuss the differential diagnosis of focal autonomic seizures
               with autonomic symptoms and signs representing the sole seizure
               manifestation versus various non-epileptic conditions.
               CONCLUSIONS: Autonomic seizure symptoms and signs are relevant
               in clinical epileptology and open a unique window on the

               (EEG) praxis often considered an irritating artefact. This
               article discusses ways by surface electromyography (EMG) to turn
               it into a valuable tool of epileptology.Muscles are in direct
               synaptic contact with motor neurons. Therefore, EMG signals
               provide direct information about the electric activity in the
               motor cortex. Qualitative analysis of EMG has traditionally been
               a part of the long-term video-EEG recordings.Recent development
               in quantitative analysis of EMG signals yielded valuable
               information on the pathomechanisms of convulsive seizures,
               demonstrating that it was different from maximal voluntary
               contraction, and different from convulsive psychogenic
               non-epileptic seizures. Furthermore, the tonic phase of the
               generalised tonic--clonic seizures (GTCS) proved to have
               different quantitative features than tonic seizures. The high
               temporal resolution of EMG allowed detailed characterisation of
               temporal dynamics of the GTCS, suggesting that the same
               inhibitory mechanisms that try to prevent the build-up of the
               seizure activity, contribute to ending the seizure.These
               findings have clinical implications: the quantitative EMG
               features provided the pathophysiologic substrate for developing
               neurophysiologic biomarkers that accurately identify GTCS. This
               proved to be efficient both for seizure detection and for

               types are critical for optimal pharmacotherapy in epilepsy

               continuously monitor physiological signals within or outside the

               single-channel surface-electromyography (sEMG) for
               characterization of motor epileptic seizure semiology. METHODS:
               Seventy-one subjects were prospectively enrolled where vEEG and
               sEMG were simultaneously recorded. Three epileptologists
               independently identified and classified seizure events with
               upper-extremity (UE) motor activity by reviewing vEEG, serving
               as a clinical standard. Surface EMG recorded during the events
               identified by the clinical standard were evaluated using
               automated classification methods and expert review by a second
               group of three independent epileptologists (blinded to the vEEG
               data). Surface EMG classification categories included:
               tonic-clonic (TC), tonic only, clonic only, or other motor
               seizures. Both automated and expert review of sEMG was compared
               to the clinical standard. RESULTS: Twenty subjects experienced
               47 motor seizures. Automated sEMG event classification methods
               accurately classified 72 \% (95 \% CI [0.57, 0.84]) of events
               (15/18 TC seizures, 5/9 tonic seizures, 1/3 clonic seizures, and
               13/17 other seizures). Three independent reviewers'
               majority-rule analysis of sEMG correctly classified 81 \% (95 \%
               CI [0.67, 0.91]) of events (16/18 TC seizures, 8/9 tonic
               seizures, 1/3 clonic seizures, and 13/17 other manifestations).
               CONCLUSIONS: Continuous monitoring of sEMG data provides an

               electrodermal activity (EDA). The aim of this study was to
               systematically review the literature to estimate the incidence
               of electrodermal response during seizures. METHODS: We searched
               all articles recording concurrent EDA and EEG activity during
               the pre-ictal, ictal, and postictal periods in children and
               adults with epilepsy. Studies reporting the total number of
               seizures and number of seizures with an EDA response were
               included for a random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: Nineteen
               studies, including 550 participants and 1115 seizures were
               reviewed. All studies demonstrated an EDA increase during the
               ictal and postictal periods, while only three reported pre-ictal
               EDA responses. The meta-analysis showed a pooled EDA response
               incidence of 82/100 seizures (95\% CI 70-91). Tonic-clonic
               seizures (both generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) and
               focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (FBTCS)) elicited a
               more pronounced (higher and longer-lasting) EDA response when
               compared with focal seizures (excluding FBTCS). DISCUSSION:
               Epileptic seizures produce an electrodermal response detectable
               by wearable devices during the pre-ictal, ictal, and postictal
               periods. Further research is needed to better understand EDA

              relevant studies addressing common themes such as usability,
              motivation, comfort, accuracy, barriers, and the financial burden
              of these devices. Usability emerged as the most frequently
              discussed factor, with patients and caregivers also emphasizing
              the importance of ease of use, long battery life, and waterproof
              design. Although validated devices showed high user satisfaction,
              technical challenges, false negatives, and false positives need
              much improvement. Motivation to use SDDs was driven by enhanced
              safety, symptom tracking, and health care professional
              recommendations. Comfort and wearability were also critical
              aspects, with users favoring lightweight, breathable, and
              discreet designs for long-term wear. Users reported the devices
              as ``comfortable'' and preferring wrist or arm-worn devices for
              the long term. Accuracy-particularly minimizing false positives
              and false negatives-was a priority for users. Barriers to
              adoption included device cost, limited insurance reimbursement,
              discomfort, and concerns about data privacy. Despite these
              challenges, many users were willing to use SDDs. Recommendations
              from health care professionals significantly increased user
              motivation. This review highlights the need for SDD designs that
              address user concerns regarding usability, comfort, looks, and
              accuracy, while also reducing financial and technical barriers.
              Enhancing clinical involvement and tailoring devices to specific
              patient needs may be crucial to promoting wider SDD adoption.
              Further research is needed to evaluate the impact of SDDs on
              quality of life and to explore ways to mitigate challenges in
              long-term use.",

  abstract  = "Electroencephalography (EEG) is the most specific method to
               define epileptogenic cortex. Its sensitivity and specificity
               depend on several factors such as age and recording procedures,
               for example, sleep recordings and activation procedures
               (hyperventilation, photic stimulation). EEG reveals
               characteristic findings in several epilepsy syndromes. Rarely,
               epileptiform discharges are recorded in healthy, particularly
               young individuals. Ictal video/EEG recording is considered to be
               critical in localizing the epileptogenic zone. A careful
               analysis of the first clinical signs and symptoms of a seizure
               and of the evolution of the seizure symptomatology can provide
               important localizing clues. Although surface EEG recordings are
               less sensitive than invasive studies, they provide the best
               overview and, therefore, the most efficient way to define the
               approximate localization of the epileptogenic zone. Invasive
               recordings are used in patients in whom the epileptogenic zone
               either cannot be located with noninvasive diagnostic methods or
               is adjacent to eloquent cortex. The most commonly used invasive
               electrodes are stereotactically implanted depth electrodes and
               subdural strip or grid electrodes. Foramen ovale and epidural
               electrodes are of intermediate invasiveness, but less sensitive.
               Invasive electrodes are subject to sampling errors if misplaced
               and should be used only after exhaustive noninvasive evaluations
               have (1) failed to localize the epileptogenic zone and (2) led
               to a testable hypothesis regarding this localization. Invasive
               EEG studies are associated with additional risks that are
               justifiable only if there is a good chance of obtaining

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: More than 30 percent of patients with epilepsy have
               inadequate control of seizures with drug therapy, but why this
               happens and whether it can be predicted are unknown. We studied
               the response to antiepileptic drugs in patients with newly
               diagnosed epilepsy to identify factors associated with
               subsequent poor control of seizures. METHODS: We prospectively
               studied 525 patients (age, 9 to 93 years) who were given a
               diagnosis, treated, and followed up at a single center between
               1984 and 1997. Epilepsy was classified as idiopathic (with a
               presumed genetic basis), symptomatic (resulting from a
               structural abnormality), or cryptogenic (resulting from an
               unknown underlying cause). Patients were considered to be
               seizure-free if they had not had any seizures for at least one
               year. RESULTS: Among the 525 patients, 333 (63 percent) remained
               seizure-free during antiepileptic-drug treatment or after
               treatment was stopped. The prevalence of persistent seizures was
               higher in patients with symptomatic or cryptogenic epilepsy than
               in those with idiopathic epilepsy (40 percent vs. 26 percent,
               P=0.004) and in patients who had had more than 20 seizures
               before starting treatment than in those who had had fewer (51
               percent vs. 29 percent, P<0.001). The seizure-free rate was
               similar in patients who were treated with a single established
               drug (67 percent) and patients who were treated with a single
               new drug (69 percent). Among 470 previously untreated patients,
               222 (47 percent) became seizure-free during treatment with their
               first antiepileptic drug and 67 (14 percent) became seizure-free
               during treatment with a second or third drug. In 12 patients (3
               percent) epilepsy was controlled by treatment with two drugs.
               Among patients who had no response to the first drug, the
               percentage who subsequently became seizure-free was smaller (11
               percent) when treatment failure was due to lack of efficacy than
               when it was due to intolerable side effects (41 percent) or an
               idiosyncratic reaction (55 percent). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who
               have many seizures before therapy or who have an inadequate
               response to initial treatment with antiepileptic drugs are
               likely to have refractory epilepsy.",

  abstract  = "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP)
               is a major contributor to premature mortality in people with
               epilepsy. This review provides an update on recent findings on
               the epidemiology of SUDEP, clinical risk factors and potential
               mechanisms. RECENT FINDINGS: The overall risk rate of SUDEP is
               approximately 1 per 1000 patients per year in the general
               epilepsy population and that children and older adults have a
               similar incidence. Generalized convulsive seizures (GCS),
               perhaps through their effects on brainstem cardiopulmonary
               networks, can cause significant postictal respiratory and
               autonomic dysfunction though other mechanisms likely exist as
               well. Work in animal models of SUDEP has identified multiple
               neurotransmitter systems, which may be future targets for
               pharmacological intervention. There are also chronic functional
               and structural changes in autonomic function in patients who
               subsequently die from SUDEP suggesting that some SUDEP risk is
               dynamic. Modifiable risks for SUDEP include GCS seizure
               frequency, medication adherence and nighttime supervision.
               SUMMARY: Current knowledge of SUDEP risk factors has identified
               multiple targets for SUDEP prevention today as we await more
               specific therapeutic targets that are emerging from

  abstract  = "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a major cause of
               epilepsy-related mortality. SUDEP is highly linked to seizures,
               with most deaths occurring after convulsive seizures in sleep.
               In most cases of SUDEP, convulsive seizures appear to directly
               trigger catastrophic cardiorespiratory dysfunction leading to
               death. In the last few decades, many pathophysiological
               mechanisms have been proposed to explain the sequence of events
               leading to death. Patients with epilepsy often have underlying
               autonomic dysfunction, as measured by heart rate variability and
               other testing modalities. Additionally, seizures often trigger
               acute cardiac and respiratory dysfunction. While sinus
               tachycardia is the most common cardiac finding during seizures,
               asystole and malignant tachyarrhythmias may also occur. Seizures
               can also lead to respiratory dysfunction, including central
               ictal and obstructive apnea related to laryngospasm. Available
               data suggest that there could be underlying autonomic
               dysfunction, potentially related to genetic, medication, and
               other factors that might predispose individuals to sudden
               catastrophic cardio-respiratory dysfunction in the setting of a
               seizure, resulting in SUDEP. Further exploration of this
               possible link is needed. Patients with medically refractory
               epilepsy are at the highest risk, and adequate management via
               medical therapy to control convulsive seizures, or surgical
               intervention may decrease the SUDEP risk. Recently, many
               automated seizure detection systems have been developed to
               detect convulsive seizures, which may enable caregivers to more
               closely monitor individuals with epilepsy. Improved
               identification of seizures may be important for patients with
               refractory epilepsy as close supervision and timely intervention
               after a seizure could potentially reduce the risk of SUDEP.",

               METHODS: In this multicenter, in-home, prospective,
               video-controlled cohort study, nocturnal seizures were detected
               by heart rate (photoplethysmography) or movement (3-D
               accelerometry) in persons with epilepsy and intellectual
               disability. Participants with >1 monthly major seizure wore a
               bracelet (Nightwatch) on the upper arm at night for 2 to 3
               months. Major seizures were tonic-clonic, generalized tonic >30
               seconds, hyperkinetic, or others, including clusters (>30
               minutes) of short myoclonic/tonic seizures. The video of all
               events (alarms, nurse diaries) and 10\% completely screened
               nights were reviewed to classify major (needing an alarm), minor
               (needing no alarm), or no seizure. Reliability was tested by
               interobserver agreement. We determined device performance,
               compared it to a bed sensor (Emfit), and evaluated the
               caregivers' user experience. RESULTS: Twenty-eight of 34
               admitted participants (1,826 nights, 809 major seizures)
               completed the study. Interobserver agreement (major/no major
               seizures) was 0.77 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.65-0.89).
               Median sensitivity per participant amounted to 86\% (95\% CI
               77\%-93\%); the false-negative alarm rate was 0.03 per night
               (95\% CI 0.01-0.05); and the positive predictive value was 49\%
               (95\% CI 33\%-64\%). The multimodal sensor showed a better
               sensitivity than the bed sensor (n = 14, median difference 58\%,
               95\% CI 39\%-80\%, p < 0.001). The caregivers' questionnaire (n
               = 33) indicated good sensor acceptance and usability according
               to 28 and 27 participants, respectively. CONCLUSION: Combining
               heart rate and movement resulted in reliable detection of a
               broad range of nocturnal seizures.},

               available that provide promising results for the detection of
               tonic-clonic seizures (TCSs), research in this area is often
               limited to detection from 1 biosignal modality or only during
               the night when the patient is in bed. The aim of this study is
               to provide evidence that supervised machine learning can detect
               TCSs from multimodal data in a new data set during daytime and
               nighttime. METHODS: An extensive data set of biosignals from a
               multimodal watch worn by people with epilepsy was recorded
               during their stay in the epilepsy monitoring unit at 2 European
               clinical sites. From a larger data set of 243 enrolled
               participants, those who had data recorded during TCSs were
               selected, amounting to 10 participants with 21 TCSs.
               Accelerometry and electrodermal activity recorded by the
               wearable device were used for analysis, and seizure
               manifestation was annotated in detail by clinical experts. Ten
               accelerometry and 3 electrodermal activity features were
               calculated for sliding windows of variable size across the data.
               A gradient tree boosting algorithm was used for seizure
               detection, and the optimal parameter combination was determined
               in a leave-one-participant-out cross-validation on a training
               set of 10 seizures from 8 participants. The model was then
               evaluated on an out-of-sample test set of 11 seizures from the
               remaining 2 participants. To assess specificity, we additionally
               analyzed data from up to 29 participants without TCSs during the
               model evaluation. RESULTS: In the leave-one-participant-out
               cross-validation, the model optimized for sensitivity could
               detect all 10 seizures with a false alarm rate of 0.46 per day
               in 17.3 days of data. In a test set of 11 out-of-sample TCSs,
               amounting to 8.3 days of data, the model could detect 10
               seizures and produced no false positives. Increasing the test
               set to include data from 28 more participants without additional
               TCSs resulted in a false alarm rate of 0.19 per day in 78 days
               of wearable data. CONCLUSIONS: We show that a gradient tree
               boosting machine can robustly detect TCSs from multimodal
               wearable data in an original data set and that even with very
               limited training data, supervised machine learning can achieve a
               high sensitivity and low false-positive rate. This methodology
               may offer a promising way to approach wearable-based
               nonconvulsive seizure detection.},

  abstract  = {PURPOSE: Focal seizures constitute the most common seizure type
               and are associated with poor control. One of the major
               difficulties in detecting focal onset with wearable devices
               seizures is related to their phenomenological complexity. We
               aimed at capturing focal onset seizures with motor
               manifestations with a multimodal wearable device to identify the
               digital semiology and the evolution pattern of ictal
               manifestations. METHODS: Participants were asked to wear a
               multimodal wearable device (IMEC) aimed at seizure detection
               while admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit. Seizures were
               labelled by a neurologist and start and offset time were noted.
               The signals captured by the device during the seizure window
               were plotted and a visual inspection was performed for focal
               motor seizures with impaired awareness and for focal motor aware
               seizures. RESULTS: Fifty-three seizures from twelve patients
               with focal seizures with motor manifestations recorded with the
               device were visually inspected. Overall, a common pattern
               presented across focal motor seizures with impaired awareness
               and it was characterized by early cardiac manifestations
               followed by motor phenomena and final EDA response. Motor
               seizures with retained awareness appeared to be characterized by
               brief motor events not associated with major autonomic
               manifestations Conclusion: an overall common digital phenotype
               and time-evolution pattern was demonstrated for focal motor
               seizures with impaired awareness. The identification of the
               evolution pattern could more precisely inform the development of
               highly preforming algorithms opening the possibility to a more
               precise, and potentially customizable way to optimize focal
               seizure detection.},

  abstract  = {Persons who suffer from intractable seizures are safer if
               attended when seizures strike. Consequently, there is a need for
               wearable devices capable of detecting both convulsive and
               nonconvulsive seizures in everyday life. We have developed a
               three-stage seizure detection methodology based on 339 h of data
               (26 seizures) collected from 10 patients in an epilepsy
               monitoring unit. Our intent is to develop a wearable system that
               will detect seizures, alert a caregiver and record the time of
               seizure in an electronic diary for the patient's physician.
               Stage I looks for concurrent activity in heart rate, arterial
               oxygenation and electrodermal activity, all of which can be
               monitored by a wrist-worn device and which in combination
               produce a very low false positive rate. Stage II looks for a
               specific pattern created by these three biosignals. For the
               patients whose seizures cannot be detected by Stage II, Stage
               III detects seizures using limited-channel electroencephalogram
               (EEG) monitoring with at most three electrodes. Out of 10
               patients, Stage I recognized all 11 seizures from seven
               patients, Stage II detected all 10 seizures from six patients
               and Stage III detected all of the seizures of two out of the
               three patients it analyzed.},

               machine learning-based algorithm for the detection of focal to
               bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (FBTCS) using a novel multimodal
               connected shirt. METHODS: We prospectively recruited patients
               with epilepsy admitted to our epilepsy monitoring unit and asked
               them to wear the connected shirt while under simultaneous
               video-electroencephalographic monitoring. Electrocardiographic
               (ECG) and accelerometric (ACC) signals recorded with the
               connected shirt were used for the development of the seizure
               detection algorithm. First, we used a sliding window to extract
               linear and nonlinear features from both ECG and ACC signals.
               Then, we trained an extreme gradient boosting algorithm
               (XGBoost) to detect FBTCS according to seizure onset and offset
               annotated by three board-certified epileptologists. Finally, we
               applied a postprocessing step to regularize the classification
               output. A patientwise nested cross-validation was implemented to
               evaluate the performances in terms of sensitivity, false alarm
               rate (FAR), time in false warning (TiW), detection latency, and
               receiver operating characteristic area under the curve
               (ROC-AUC). RESULTS: We recorded 66 FBTCS from 42 patients who
               wore the connected shirt for a total of 8067 continuous hours.
               The XGBoost algorithm reached a sensitivity of 84.8\% (56/66
               seizures), with a median FAR of .55/24 h and a median TiW of 10
               s/alarm. ROC-AUC was .90 (95\% confidence interval = .88-.91).
               Median detection latency from the time of progression to the
               bilateral tonic-clonic phase was 25.5 s. SIGNIFICANCE: The novel
               connected shirt allowed accurate detection of FBTCS with a low
               false alarm rate in a hospital setting. Prospective studies in a
               residential setting with a real-time and online seizure
               detection algorithm are required to validate the performance and
               usability of this device.},

  abstract  = {This paper investigates the feasibility of using non-cerebral,
               time-series data to detect epileptic seizures. Data were
               recorded from fifteen patients (7 male, 5 female, 3 not noted,
               mean age 36.17 yrs), five of whom had a total of seven seizures.
               Patients were monitored in an inpatient setting using standard
               video-electroencephalography (vEEG), while also wearing sensors
               monitoring electrocardiography, electrodermal activity,
               electromyography, accelerometry, and audio signals
               (vocalizations). A systematic and detailed study was conducted
               to identify the sensors and the features derived from the
               non-cerebral sensors that contribute most significantly to
               separability of data acquired during seizures from non-seizure
               data. Post-processing of the data using linear discriminant
               analysis (LDA) shows that seizure data are strongly separable
               from non-seizure data based on features derived from the signals
               recorded. The mean area under the receiver operator
               characteristic (ROC) curve for each individual patient that
               experienced a seizure during data collection, calculated using
               LDA, was 0.9682. The features that contribute most significantly
               to seizure detection differ for each patient. The results show
               that a multimodal approach to seizure detection using the
               specified sensor suite is promising in detecting seizures with
               both sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, the study provides a
               means to quantify the contribution of each sensor and feature to
               separability. Development of a non-electroencephalography (EEG)
               based seizure detection device would give doctors a more
               accurate seizure count outside of the clinical setting,

  abstract  = {The unpredictable nature of epileptic seizures makes it
               challenging to detect and effectively treat this disorder. The
               seizures are random, and most epileptic patients experience
               dangerous physical symptoms during an attack that renders the
               patient uneasy when conducting their daily tasks. This paper
               focuses on the generalised type of epilepsy, namely ``Grand mal
               epilepsy Tonic-Clonic (GTC) seizure. The research aims to
               monitor symptoms of epileptic disease behaviour signals in
               humans and prevent it at its early stage of illness. To achieve
               this objective, we used the Electrocardiogram (ECG),
               Electromyography (EMG), accelerometer 3-axes for fall detection,
               and Dallas sensor for body temperature signals monitoring for
               updating the IoT system. The fuzzy logic algorithm that has been
               used to assess specified data set of diseased patients'
               parameters allows the classification into diverse types of
               seizures such as heart rate, body temperature, muscles spasm and
               falls. These are used as inputs to obtain the seizure type as an
               output which is then illustrated graphically on the dashboard of
               an IoT platform (Think-Speak), where abnormal conditions have

               is influenced by different factors such as etiology, seizure
               type and frequency, treatment, and environment. A greater
               severity of epilepsy, in terms of seizure frequency, seizures
               type, especially with nocturnal generalized tonic-clonic
               seizures (GTCS), and resistance to anti-seizure medication are
               predisposing factors to SUDEP. Potential mechanisms of SUDEP
               might involve respiratory, cardiovascular, and central autonomic
               dysfunctions, either combined or in isolation. Patients with
               epilepsy carrying mutations in cardiac channelopathy genes might
               be disposed to seizure-induced arrhythmias. Other than in
               channelopathies, SUDEP has been reported in further patients
               with genetic epilepsies due to mutations of genes such as
               DEPDC5, TBC1D24, FHF1, or 5q14.3 deletion. Age-related
               electro-clinical differences in GTCS may therefore be relevant
               in explaining differences in SUDEP between adults and children.
               Typical GTCS represent a rare seizure type in infants and
               toddlers, they are characterized by a shorter tonic phase and,
               in direct proportion, by shorter postictal generalized EEG
               suppression (PGES). The presence of night-time supervision has
               been found to reduce SUDEP risk, likely reducing SUDEP incidence
               in children. Reconsideration of safety protocols in epilepsy
               monitoring units with the aim of reducing the risk of SUDEP, and
               the use of devices for seizure detection, might contribute to
               reduce the risk of death in patients affected by epilepsy. This

  abstract  = {INTRODUCTION: We evaluated a multi-parametric approach to
               seizure detection using cardiac and activity features to detect
               a wide range of seizures across different people using the same
               model. METHODS: Electrocardiogram (ECG) and accelerometer data
               were collected from a chest-worn sensor from 62 children aged
               2-17 years undergoing video-electroencephalogram monitoring for
               clinical care. ECG data from 5 adults aged 31-48 years who
               experienced focal seizures were also analyzed from the PhysioNet
               database. A detection algorithm was developed based on a
               combination of multiple heart rhythm and motion parameters.
               RESULTS: Excluding patients with multiple seizures per hour and
               myoclonic jerks, 25 seizures were captured from 18 children.
               Using cardiac parameters only, 11/12 generalized seizures with
               clonic or tonic activity were detected as well as 7/13 focal
               seizures without generalization. Separately, cardiac parameters
               were evaluated using electrocardiogram data from 10 complex
               partial seizures in the PhysioNet database of which 7 were
               detected. False alarms averaged one per day. Movement-based
               parameters did not identify any seizures missed by cardiac
               parameters, but did improve detection time for 4 of the
               generalized seizures. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that cardiac
               measures can detect seizures with bilateral motor features with
               high sensitivity, while detection of focal seizures depends on
               seizure duration and localization and may require customization
               of parameter thresholds.},

  abstract = {Our current understanding of human physiology and activities is
              largely derived from sparse and discrete individual clinical
              measurements. To achieve precise, proactive, and effective health
              management of an individual, longitudinal, and dense tracking of
              personal physiomes and activities is required, which is only
              feasible by utilizing wearable biosensors. As a pilot study, we
              implemented a cloud computing infrastructure to integrate
              wearable sensors, mobile computing, digital signal processing,
              and machine learning to improve early detection of seizure onsets
              in children. We recruited 99 children diagnosed with epilepsy and
              longitudinally tracked them at single-second resolution using a
              wearable wristband, and prospectively acquired more than one
              billion data points. This unique dataset offered us an
              opportunity to quantify physiological dynamics (e.g., heart rate,
              stress response) across age groups and to identify physiological
              irregularities upon epilepsy onset. The high-dimensional personal
              physiome and activity profiles displayed a clustering pattern
              anchored by patient age groups. These signatory patterns included
              strong age and sex-specific effects on varying circadian rhythms
              and stress responses across major childhood developmental stages.
              For each patient, we further compared the physiological and
              activity profiles associated with seizure onsets with the
              personal baseline and developed a machine learning framework to
              accurately capture these onset moments. The performance of this
              framework was further replicated in another independent patient
              cohort. We next referenced our predictions with the
              electroencephalogram (EEG) signals on selected patients and
              demonstrated that our approach could detect subtle seizures not
              recognized by humans and could detect seizures prior to clinical
              onset. Our work demonstrated the feasibility of a real-time
              mobile infrastructure in a clinical setting, which has the
              potential to be valuable in caring for epileptic patients.
              Extension of such a system has the potential to be leveraged as a
              health management device or longitudinal phenotyping tool in
              clinical cohort studies.},

               seizures with visible clinical manifestation using a wearable

               dataset prospectively recorded for this study included 70 tonic
               seizures from 15 patients (seven males, age 3-46 years, median =
               19 years). We trained an ANN model to detect tonic seizures. The
               independent test dataset comprised nocturnal recordings,
               including 10 tonic seizures from three patients and additional
               (distractor) data from three subjects without seizures. The ANN
               model detected nocturnal tonic seizures with visible clinical
               manifestation with a sensitivity of 100\% (95\% confidence
               interval = 69\%-100\%) and with an average false alarm rate of

               s), with a maximum of 47 s. These data suggest that nocturnal
               tonic seizures can be reliably detected with movement sensors

  abstract  = {OBJECTIVE: Seizure forecasting may provide patients with timely
               warnings to adapt their daily activities and help clinicians
               deliver more objective, personalized treatments. Although recent
               work has convincingly demonstrated that seizure risk assessment
               is in principle possible, these early approaches relied largely
               on complex, often invasive setups including intracranial
               electrocorticography, implanted devices, and multichannel
               electroencephalography, and required patient-specific adaptation
               or learning to perform optimally, all of which limit translation
               to broad clinical application. To facilitate broader adaptation
               of seizure forecasting in clinical practice, noninvasive, easily
               applicable techniques that reliably assess seizure risk without
               much prior tuning are crucial. Wristbands that continuously
               record physiological parameters, including electrodermal
               activity, body temperature, blood volume pulse, and actigraphy,
               may afford monitoring of autonomous nervous system function and
               movement relevant for such a task, hence minimizing potential
               complications associated with invasive monitoring and avoiding
               stigma associated with bulky external monitoring devices on the
               head. METHODS: Here, we applied deep learning on multimodal
               wristband sensor data from 69 patients with epilepsy (total
               duration > 2311 hours, 452 seizures) to assess its capability to
               forecast seizures in a statistically significant way. RESULTS:
               Using a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation approach, we
               identified better-than-chance predictability in 43\% of the
               patients. Time-matched seizure surrogate data analyses indicated
               forecasting not to be driven simply by time of day or vigilance
               state. Prediction performance peaked when all sensor modalities
               were used, and did not differ between generalized and focal
               seizure types, but generally increased with the size of the
               training dataset, indicating potential further improvement with
               larger datasets in the future. SIGNIFICANCE: Collectively, these
               results show that statistically significant seizure risk
               assessments are feasible from easy-to-use, noninvasive wearable
               devices without the need of patient-specific training or

               would improve epilepsy management, but reliable detection of
               seizures in an ambulatory environment remains challenging, and
               current studies lack concurrent validation of seizures using
               electroencephalography (EEG) data.Approach. An adaptively
               trained long-short-term memory deep neural network was developed
               and trained using a modest number of seizure data sets from
               wrist-worn devices. Transfer learning was used to adapt a
               classifier that was initially trained on intracranial
               electroencephalography (iEEG) signals to facilitate
               classification of non-EEG physiological datasets comprising
               accelerometry, blood volume pulse, skin electrodermal activity,
               heart rate, and temperature signals. The algorithm's performance
               was assessed with and without pre-training on iEEG signals and
               transfer learning. To assess the performance of the seizure
               detection classifier using long-term ambulatory data, wearable
               devices were used for multiple months with an implanted
               neurostimulator capable of recording iEEG signals, which
               provided independent electrographic seizure detections that were
               reviewed by a board-certified epileptologist.Main results. For
               19 motor seizures from 10 in-hospital patients, the algorithm
               yielded a mean area under curve (AUC), a sensitivity, and an
               false alarm rate per day (FAR/day) of 0.98, 0.93, and 2.3,
               respectively. Additionally, for eight seizures with probable
               motor semiology from two ambulatory patients, the classifier
               achieved a mean AUC of 0.97 and an FAR of 2.45 events/day at a
               sensitivity of 0.9. For all seizure types in the ambulatory
               setting, the classifier had a mean AUC of 0.82 with a
               sensitivity of 0.47 and an FAR of 7.2 events/day.Significance.
               The performance of the algorithm was evaluated using motor and
               non-motor seizures during in-hospital and ambulatory use. The
               classifier was able to detect multiple types of motor and

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to describe extracerebral
              biosignal characteristics of overall and various seizure types as
              compared with baseline physical activities using multimodal
              devices (Empatica E4); develop predictive models for overall and
              each seizure type; and assess diagnostic performance of each
              model. METHODS: We prospectively recruited patients with focal
              epilepsy who were admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for
              presurgical evaluation during January to December 2020. All study
              participants were simultaneously applied gold standard long-term
              video-electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring and an index test,
              E4. Two certified epileptologists independently determined
              whether captured events were seizures and then indicated ictal
              semiology and EEG information. Both were blind to multimodal
              biosignal findings detected by E4. Biosignals during 5-min epochs
              of both seizure events and baseline were collected and compared.
              Predictive models for occurrence overall and of each seizure type
              were developed using a generalized estimating equation.
              Diagnostic performance of each model was then assessed. RESULTS:
              Thirty patients had events recorded and were recruited for
              analysis. One hundred eight seizure events and 120 baseline
              epochs were collected. Heart rate (HR), acceleration (ACC), and
              electrodermal activity (EDA) but not temperature were
              significantly elevated during seizures. Cluster analysis showed
              trends of greatest elevation of HR and ACC in bilateral
              tonic-clonic seizures (BTCs), as compared with non-BTCs and
              isolated auras. HR and ACC were independent predictors for
              overall seizure types, BTCs, and non-BTCs, whereas only HR was a
              predictor for isolated aura. Diagnostic performance including
              sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating
              characteristic (ROC) curve of the predictive model for overall
              seizures were 77.78\%, 60\%, and .696 (95\% confidence interval =
              .628-.764), respectively. SIGNIFICANCE: Multimodal extracerebral
              biosignals (HR, ACC, EDA) detected by a wrist-worn smartwatch can
              help differentiate between epileptic seizures and normal physical
              activities. It would be worthwhile to implement our predictive
              algorithms in commercial seizure detection devices. However,
              larger studies to externally validate our predictive models are
              required.},

               call for alternatives to electroencephalography (EEG)-based
               methods. Therefore, we developed an algorithm for automatic
               detection of generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures based on
               sympathetically mediated electrodermal activity (EDA) and
               accelerometry measured using a novel wrist-worn biosensor. The

               seizure or nonseizure event based on 19 extracted features from
               EDA and accelerometry recordings using a Support Vector Machine.
               Performance was evaluated using a double cross-validation

  abstract  = {Wearable automated seizure detection devices offer a high
               potential to improve seizure management, through continuous
               ambulatory monitoring, accurate seizure counts, and real-time
               alerts for prompt intervention. More importantly, these devices
               can be a life-saving help for people with a higher risk of
               sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), especially in case
               of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS). The Embrace and E4
               wristbands (Empatica) are the first commercially available
               multimodal wristbands that were designed to sense the
               physiological hallmarks of ongoing GTCS: while Embrace only
               embeds a machine learning-based detection algorithm, both E4 and
               Embrace devices are equipped with motion (accelerometers, ACC)
               and electrodermal activity (EDA) sensors and both the devices
               received medical clearance (E4 from EU CE, Embrace from EU CE
               and US FDA). The aim of this contribution is to provide updated
               evidence of the effectiveness of GTCS detection and monitoring
               relying on the combination of ACM and EDA sensors. A machine
               learning algorithm able to recognize ACC and EDA signatures of
               GTCS-like events has been developed on E4 data, labeled using
               gold-standard video-EEG examined by epileptologists in clinical
               centers, and has undergone continuous improvement. While keeping
               an elevated sensitivity to GTCS (92-100\%), algorithm
               improvements and growing data availability led to lower false
               alarm rate (FAR) from the initial ˜2 down to 0.2-1 false alarms
               per day, as showed by retrospective and prospective analyses in
               inpatient settings. Algorithm adjustment to better discriminate
               real-life physical activities from GTCS, has brought the initial
               FAR of ˜6 on outpatient real life settings, down to values
               comparable to best-case clinical settings (FAR < 0.5), with
               comparable sensitivity. Moreover, using multimodal sensing, it
               has been possible not only to detect GTCS but also to quantify
               seizure-induced autonomic dysfunction, based on automatic
               features of abnormal motion and EDA. The latter biosignal
               correlates with the duration of post-ictal generalized EEG
               suppression, a biomarker observed in 100\% of monitored SUDEP
               cases.},

  abstract  = {OBJECTIVE: Tracking seizures is crucial for epilepsy monitoring
               and treatment evaluation. Current epilepsy care relies on
               caretaker seizure diaries, but clinical seizure monitoring may
               miss seizures. Wearable devices may be better tolerated and more
               suitable for long-term ambulatory monitoring. This study
               evaluates the seizure detection performance of custom-developed
               machine learning (ML) algorithms across a broad spectrum of
               epileptic seizures utilizing wrist- and ankle-worn multisignal
               biosensors. METHODS: We enrolled patients admitted to the
               epilepsy monitoring unit and asked them to wear a wearable
               sensor on either their wrists or ankles. The sensor recorded
               body temperature, electrodermal activity, accelerometry (ACC),
               and photoplethysmography, which provides blood volume pulse
               (BVP). We used electroencephalographic seizure onset and offset
               as determined by a board-certified epileptologist as a standard
               comparison. We trained and validated ML for two different
               algorithms: Algorithm 1, ML methods for developing seizure
               type-specific detection models for nine individual seizure
               types; and Algorithm 2, ML methods for building general seizure
               type-agnostic detection, lumping together all seizure types.
               RESULTS: We included 94 patients (57.4\% female, median age =
               9.9 years) and 548 epileptic seizures (11 066 h of sensor data)
               for a total of 930 seizures and nine seizure types. Algorithm 1
               detected eight of nine seizure types better than chance (area
               under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC-ROC] =
               .648-.976). Algorithm 2 detected all nine seizure types better
               than chance (AUC-ROC = .642-.995); a fusion of ACC and BVP
               modalities achieved the best AUC-ROC (.752) when combining all
               seizure types together. SIGNIFICANCE: Automatic seizure
               detection using ML from multimodal wearable sensor data is
               feasible across a broad spectrum of epileptic seizures.
               Preliminary results show better than chance seizure detection.
               The next steps include validation of our results in larger
               datasets, evaluation of the detection utility tool for
               additional clinical seizure types, and integration of additional
               clinical information.},

               Samsung watch (SM-R800), and evaluate its effectiveness for the
               detection of generalized convulsive seizures (GCS) in persons
               with epilepsy. METHODS: This multisite epilepsy monitoring unit
               (EMU) phase 2 study included 36 adult patients. Each patient
               wore a Samsung watch that contained accelerometer, gyroscope,
               and photoplethysmographic sensors. Sixty-eight time and
               frequency domain features were extracted from the sensor data
               and were used to train a random forest algorithm. A testing
               framework was developed that would better reflect the EMU
               setting, consisting of (1) leave-one-patient-out
               cross-validation (LOPO CV) on GCS patients, (2) false alarm rate
               (FAR) testing on nonseizure patients, and (3)
               ``fixed-and-frozen'' prospective testing on a prospective
               patient cohort. Balanced accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and
               FAR were used to quantify the performance of the algorithm.
               Seizure onsets and offsets were determined by using
               video-electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring. Feature
               importance was calculated as the mean decrease in Gini impurity
               during the LOPO CV testing. RESULTS: LOPO CV results showed
               balanced accuracy of .93 (95\% confidence interval [CI] =
               .8-.98), precision of .68 (95\% CI = .46-.85), sensitivity of
               .87 (95\% CI = .62-.96), and FAR of .21/24 h (interquartile
               range [IQR] = 0-.90). Testing the algorithm on patients without
               seizure resulted in an FAR of .28/24 h (IQR = 0-.61). During the
               ``fixed-and-frozen'' prospective testing, two patients had three
               GCS, which were detected by the algorithm, while generating an
               FAR of .25/24 h (IQR = 0-.89). Feature importance showed that
               heart rate-based features outperformed
               accelerometer/gyroscope-based features. SIGNIFICANCE:
               Commercially available wearable digital watches that reliably
               detect GCS, with minimum false alarm rates, may overcome usage
               adoption and other limitations of custom-built devices.
               Contingent on the outcomes of a prospective phase 3 study, such
               devices have the potential to provide non-EEG-based seizure
               surveillance and forecasting in the clinical setting.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Predicting seizure likelihood for the following day
              would enable clinicians to extend or potentially schedule
              video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring when seizure risk
              is high. Combining standardized clinical data with short-term
              recordings of wearables to predict seizure likelihood could have
              high practical relevance as wearable data is easy and fast to
              collect. As a first step toward seizure forecasting, we
              classified patients based on whether they had seizures or not
              during the following recording. METHODS: Pediatric patients
              admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit wore a wearable that
              recorded the heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV),
              electrodermal activity (EDA), and peripheral body temperature. We
              utilized short recordings from 9:00 to 9:15 pm and compared mean
              values between patients with and without impending seizures. In
              addition, we collected clinical data: age, sex, age at first
              seizure, generalized slowing, focal slowing, and spikes on EEG,
              magnetic resonance imaging findings, and antiseizure medication
              reduction. We used conventional machine learning techniques with
              cross-validation to classify patients with and without impending
              seizures. RESULTS: We included 139 patients: 78 had no seizures
              and 61 had at least one seizure after 9 pm during the concurrent
              video-EEG and E4 recordings. HR (P < 0.01) and EDA (P < 0.01)
              were lower and HRV (P = 0.02) was higher for patients with than
              for patients without impending seizures. The average accuracy of
              group classification was 66\%, and the mean area under the
              receiver operating characteristics was 0.72. CONCLUSIONS:
              Short-term wearable recordings in combination with clinical data
              have great potential as an easy-to-use seizure likelihood
              assessment tool.},

  abstract  = {OBJECTIVE: Wearable devices are effective for detecting
               generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS). However, many daily
               activities are often misclassified as GTCS, leading to a decline
               in user confidence. This study recommends utilizing wristband
               three-axis accelerometer (ACC), three-axis gyroscope (GYRO), and
               surface electromyography (sEMG) signals for GTCS detection and
               presents a novel seizure detection algorithm that offers high
               sensitivity and a reduced false alarm rate (FAR). METHODS:
               Inpatients with epilepsy and out-of-hospital healthy subjects
               were recruited and required to wear a wristband device to
               collect wristband signals. The proposed algorithm comprises five
               steps: preprocessing, motion filtering, feature extraction,
               classification, and postprocessing. The variations in
               performance across different signal combinations were compared.
               Additionally, the impact of training the model using only
               inpatient data versus the complete dataset on the algorithm's
               performance was also investigated. RESULTS: Wristband signals
               were collected from 45 patients and 30 healthy subjects,
               encompassing a total of 3367.3 h and including 60 GTCS. The
               proposed algorithm achieved 100 \% sensitivity and a FAR of
               0.1070/24 h. It demonstrated higher sensitivity and lower FAR
               compared to combinations with fewer signal modalities. In
               addition, the model trained on only in-hospital data
               demonstrates high sensitivity (98.33 \%) and high FAR (0.9845/24
               h). SIGNIFICANCE: The algorithm proposed for detecting GTCS
               using wristband ACC, GYRO, and sEMG signals achieved encouraging
               results, demonstrating the feasibility of this signal
               combination. Furthermore, incorporating out-of-hospital data
               into model training proved to be an effective solution for
               reducing FAR, which could facilitate the clinical application of
               seizure detection algorithms.},

  abstract  = {OBJECTIVE: Wrist- or ankle-worn devices are less intrusive than
               the widely used electroencephalographic (EEG) systems for
               monitoring epileptic seizures. Using custom-developed
               deep-learning seizure detection models, we demonstrate the
               detection of a broad range of seizure types by wearable signals.
               METHODS: Patients admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit were
               enrolled and asked to wear wearable sensors on either wrists or
               ankles. We collected patients' electrodermal activity,
               accelerometry (ACC), and photoplethysmography, from which blood
               volume pulse (BVP) is derived. Board-certified epileptologists
               determined seizure onset, offset, and types using video and EEG
               recordings per the International League Against Epilepsy 2017
               classification. We applied three neural network models-a
               convolutional neural network (CNN) and a CNN-long short-term
               memory (LSTM)-based generalized detection model and an
               autoencoder-based personalized detection model-to the raw
               time-series sensor data to detect seizures and utilized
               performance measures, including sensitivity, false positive rate
               (the number of false alarms divided by the total number of
               nonseizure segments), number of false alarms per day, and
               detection delay. We applied a 10-fold patientwise
               cross-validation scheme to the multisignal biosensor data and
               evaluated model performance on 28 seizure types. RESULTS: We
               analyzed 166 patients (47.6\% female, median age = 10.0 years)
               and 900 seizures (13 254 h of sensor data) for 28 seizure types.
               With a CNN-LSTM-based seizure detection model, ACC, BVP, and
               their fusion performed better than chance; ACC and BVP data
               fusion reached the best detection performance of 83.9\%
               sensitivity and 35.3\% false positive rate. Nineteen of 28
               seizure types could be detected by at least one data modality
               with area under receiver operating characteristic curve > .8
               performance. SIGNIFICANCE: Results from this in-hospital study
               contribute to a paradigm shift in epilepsy care that entails
               noninvasive seizure detection, provides time-sensitive and
               accurate data on additional clinical seizure types, and proposes
               a novel combination of an out-of-the-box monitoring algorithm

Advances in neonatal care have improved outcomes for some of our most fragile patients, but there are persistent challenges for epileptologists in identifying neonatal seizures, diagnosing etiologies, and providing the most appropriate care, with an ultimate goal to maximize patient outcomes. In just the last few years, there have been critical advances in the state of the science, as well as new evidence-based guidelines for diagnosis, classification, and treatment of neonatal seizures. This review provides updated knowledge about the pathophysiology of neonatal seizures, classification of the provoked seizures and neonatal epilepsies, state-of-the-art guidance on EEG monitoring in the neonatal ICU, current treatment guidelines, and potential for future advancement in treatment.}

  abstract  = {Neonatal seizure is an important clinical symptom of brain 
               dysfunction, which is more common in infancy than in childhood. 
               At present, video electroencephalogram (VEEG) technology is widely 
               used in clinical practice. However, VEEG technology has several 
               disadvantages, such as interference with infant movement due to 
               connecting wires and skin irritation from gel patch or disk 
               electrodes. To address these issues, we developed a wearable 
               multi-sensor platform for newborns to collect physiological and 
               movement signals. In this study, we designed a second-generation 
               multi-sensor platform and developed an automatic detection 
               algorithm for neonatal seizures based on ECG, respiration, and 
               acceleration. Data for 38 neonates were recorded at the Children’s 
               Hospital of Fudan University in Shanghai, totaling approximately 
               300 h of recordings. Four patients had seizures during data 
               collection (30 episodes in total). Three seizure detectors were 
               compared: one using ECG, respiration, and acceleration features; 
               one using respiration and acceleration; and one using ECG alone. 
               Results show that multimodal feature detectors achieved better 
               overall performance, reduced false alarms, and higher F-measures 
               than unimodal detectors.},
