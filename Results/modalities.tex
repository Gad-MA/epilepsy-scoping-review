\subsection{Modalities}

Among the 36 reviewed studies, accelerometry (ACC) was the most frequently used modality, appearing in 34 studies. This was followed by electrodermal activity (EDA) in 16, gyroscopes (GYRO) in 14, and electromyography (EMG) in 12 studies. Electrocardiography (ECG) was included in 9 papers, while temperature (TEMP) appeared in 7.
Less commonly used modalities included photoplethysmography (PPG) and heart rate (HR), each in 5 studies, and SpO$_2$ and blood volume pulse (BVP), each in 2. Rare modalities, used only once, included audio, GSR, pulse sensor, SCR, NOWM, pitch, and roll. Many studies used multiple modalities in combination, often pairing motion and physiological signals.
