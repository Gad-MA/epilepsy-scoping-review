\subsection{Demographics}

Reviewed studies included adults only, pediatrics only, or a mixed population as follows: Five studies \cite{Cogan2017-lg, Hamlin2021-sd, Chowdhury2022-bi, Vakilna2024-hk, Ali2020-ke} focused solely on adults aged 20 \cite{Chowdhury2022-bi} to 64 years \cite{Cogan2017-lg} . From which, One Study provided the mean age only \cite{Hamlin2021-sd}, and one also providing the standard deviation \cite{Vakilna2024-hk}. Eleven (42.3\%) studies \cite{Yu2023-ss, Milosevic2016-ee, Hegarty-Craver2021-hk, De_Cooman2018-pq, Poh2012-af, Wu2024-yl, Gheryani2017-yg, Ge2023-ab, Wang2025-ql, Jiang2022-zu, Tang2021-td} were conducted exclusively on pediatric patients aged between 1 month \cite{Jiang2022-zu} and 17 years \cite{Hegarty-Craver2021-hk}. Among these, Two studies \cite{Milosevic2016-ee, De_Cooman2018-pq} did not specify exact ages but indicated inclusion of children, while four provided both mean and median ages only \cite{Yu2023-ss, Poh2012-af, Ge2023-ab, Tang2021-td}. Ten studies \cite{Van_Andel2017-yx, Wang2022-lt, Regalia2019-ch, Nasseri2021-xn, Arends2018-ew, Larsen2024-vn, Dong2022-oo, Li2022-ty, Xu2022-tx, Wang2025-my} included mixed-age populations, with ages spanning from 2 \cite{Van_Andel2017-yx} to 75 years\cite{Larsen2024-vn}, including two studies that did not specify the age range \cite{Nasseri2021-xn, Xu2022-tx}. In addition to seizure patients, Five studies included control groups to test the performance of their seizure detection methods \cite{Van_Andel2017-yx, Wang2022-lt, Vakilna2024-hk, Larsen2024-vn, Wang2025-my}. Sample sizes varied widely, ranging from 7 \cite{De_Cooman2018-pq} to 166 participants \cite{Yu2023-ss} in pediatric studies, from 5 patients \cite{Ali2020-ke} to 36 \cite{Vakilna2024-hk} in adult studies, and from 4 patients \cite{Li2022-ty} to 135 patients \cite{Regalia2019-ch} in the mixed-age population. Of the reviewed studies, twenty (76.9\%) were conducted in inpatient settings, Three studies in outpatient settings \cite{Wang2022-lt, Chowdhury2022-bi, Dong2022-oo}, and three were conducted in both settings \cite{Regalia2019-ch, Nasseri2021-xn, Wang2025-my}. Nine (34.62\%) studies targeted generalized tonic-clonic and/or tonic-clonic seizures only \cite{Milosevic2016-ee, Wang2022-lt, De_Cooman2018-pq, Poh2012-af, Vakilna2024-hk, Larsen2024-vn, Li2022-ty, Xu2022-tx, Wang2025-my}. Four (15.38\%) studies focused solely on nocturnal seizures \cite{Van_Andel2017-yx, De_Cooman2018-pq, Gheryani2017-yg, Larsen2024-vn}.
