\subsection{Demographics}

Of the studies reviewed, 25 were conducted exclusively in inpatient settings. One study didn’t explicitly state the setting, but it is implied for home monitoring. 2 studies included data from both inpatient and outpatient environments. Sample sizes varied widely, ranging from as few as 4 to as many as 166  participants. Four studies focused solely on adults aged 18 to 64 years, with one additional adult study not specifying the age range, and 2 providing the mean age only. Ten studies were conducted exclusively in pediatric populations, including two that did not specify exact ages but stated that participants were children. Twelve studies included mixed-age populations, with ages spanning from 2 to 75 years, including three that didn’t specify the age range. Six studies did not provide any information about the participants' ages. Additionally, three studies included healthy participants to test the performance of their seizure detection methods.
