\subsection{Participants Demographics}
\subsubsection{Detection}
Nine (34.62\%) studies targeted generalized tonic-clonic and/or tonic-clonic seizures only \cite{Milosevic2016-ee,Wang2022-lt,De_Cooman2018-pq,Poh2012-af,Vakilna2024-hk,Larsen2024-vn,Li2022-ty,Xu2022-tx,Wang2025-my}. Four (15.38\%) studies focused solely on nocturnal seizures \cite{Van_Andel2017-yx,De_Cooman2018-pq,Gheryani2017-yg,Larsen2024-vn}.

Studies included either adults, pediatrics or a mixed population as follows: Five studies \cite{Cogan2017-lg,Hamlin2021-sd,Chowdhury2022-bi,Ali2020-ke,Vakilna2024-hk} focused solely on adults aged 20 \cite{Chowdhury2022-bi} to 64 years \cite{Cogan2017-lg}. From which, only one study provided the mean age \cite{Hamlin2021-sd}, and another the mean and standard deviation \cite{Vakilna2024-hk}. Eleven out of 26 (42.3\%) studies \cite{Yu2023-ss,Milosevic2016-ee,Hegarty-Craver2021-hk,De_Cooman2018-pq,Poh2012-af,Wu2024-yl,Gheryani2017-yg,Ge2023-ab,Wang2025-ql,Jiang2022-zu,Tang2021-td} were conducted exclusively on pediatric patients aged between 1 month \cite{Jiang2022-zu} and 17 years \cite{Hegarty-Craver2021-hk}. Among these, two studies \cite{De_Cooman2018-pq,Milosevic2016-ee} did not specify exact age but indicated inclusion of children, while four provided both mean and median ages only \cite{Yu2023-ss,Poh2012-af,Ge2023-ab,Tang2021-td}. Ten studies \cite{Regalia2019-ch,Nasseri2021-xn,Van_Andel2017-yx,Arends2018-ew,Wang2022-lt,Larsen2024-vn,Dong2022-oo,Li2022-ty,Xu2022-tx,Wang2025-my} included mixed-age populations, with age ranging from 2 \cite{Van_Andel2017-yx} to 75 years \cite{Larsen2024-vn}, including two studies that did not specify the age range \cite{Xu2022-tx,Nasseri2021-xn}. In addition to seizure patients, five studies included control groups to test the performance of their seizure detection methods \cite{Van_Andel2017-yx,Vakilna2024-hk,Wang2022-lt,Larsen2024-vn,Wang2025-my}. 

Sample sizes varied from 7 \cite{De_Cooman2018-pq} to 166 participants \cite{Yu2023-ss} in studies involving children, and from 5 patients \cite{Ali2020-ke} to 36 \cite{Vakilna2024-hk} in studies including adults, and from 4 patients \cite{Li2022-ty} to 135 patients \cite{Regalia2019-ch} in the mixed-age population studies. 

Twenty studies (76.9\%) were conducted in inpatient settings, three studies in outpatient settings \cite{Chowdhury2022-bi,Wang2022-lt,Dong2022-oo}, and three were conducted in both settings \cite{Wang2025-my,Regalia2019-ch,Nasseri2021-xn}. 

\subsubsection{Prediction and Forecasting}
The three prediction studies were more uniform in the demographics of enrolled participants. The number of patients included in data acquisition ranged from 42 \cite{Vieluf2023-ta} to 139 \cite{Vieluf2023-zv}, with mean ages ranged between 9.8 \cite{Meisel2020-ii} and 14 \cite{Vieluf2023-ta} years, indicating a pediatric-dominant cohort. Two studies \cite{Vieluf2023-zv,Vieluf2023-ta} also included a control group (patients with no seizures) to differentiate seizure-related patterns from normal brain activity. All prediction studies were conducted in an inpatient setting.
