\subsection{Demographics}

Of the studies reviewed, 25 were conducted exclusively in inpatient settings. One study didn’t explicitly state the setting, but it is implied for home monitoring \cite{Hassan2022-do}. 2 studies included data from both inpatient and outpatient environments \cite{Regalia2019-ch, Nasseri2021-xn}. Sample sizes varied widely, ranging from as few as 4 \cite{Li2022-ty} to as many as 166 \cite{Yu2023-ss} participants. Five studies focused solely on adults aged 18 \cite{Gharbi2024-ad} to 64 \cite{Cogan2017-lg} years, with one additional adult study not specifying the age range \cite{Bottcher2021-zl}, and 1 providing the mean age only \cite{Hamlin2021-sd}. Ten studies were conducted exclusively in pediatric populations, including two that did not specify exact ages but stated that participants were children \cite{Milosevic2016-ee, De_Cooman2018-pq}. Twelve studies included mixed-age populations, with ages spanning from 2 \cite{Van_Andel2017-yx} to 75 \cite{Larsen2024-vn} years, including three that didn’t specify the age range \cite{Nasseri2021-xn, Regalia2019-ch, Xu2022-tx}. Six studies did not provide any information about the participants' ages. Additionally, three studies included healthy participants to test the performance of their seizure detection methods \cite{Wang2022-lt, Larsen2024-vn, Wang2025-my}.
