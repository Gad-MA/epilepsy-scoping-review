\section{Results}

A total of 26 studies, concerned with seizure detection, were included in this review (\href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FjxwkHFbNDM84nuqg513gR_0vIVql-evoT1EMiqSYZU/edit?pli=1&gid=1255223968#gid=1255223968}{Table S1}). These studies utilized a range of commercial and non-commercial devices for seizure detection. The most frequently used commercial device was the Empatica E4 (includes sensors for ACC, EDA, PPG, TEMP), which was tested in 15.4\% of the studies \cite{Yu2023-ss, Regalia2019-ch,Nasseri2021-xn, Tang2021-td}. Additional studies employed either customized laboratory-developed devices or other commercial devices, such as: Shimmer \cite{Van_Andel2017-yx, Gheryani2017-yg}, Samsung SM-R800 watch \cite{Vakilna2024-hk}, Mi- Microsoft wristband\cite{Jiang2022-zu}, Nightwatch \cite{Arends2018-ew}, and Biovital P1 System \cite{Wu2024-yl, Wang2025-ql}.

All included studies assessed various combinations of the following physiological and movement sensors and measures: ACC, BVP, GYR, sEMG, HR, HRV, SpO$_2$, EDA, ECG, and TEMP.

For seizure prediction and forecasting, three studies were found eligible \cite{Vieluf2023-ta,Vieluf2023-zv,Meisel2020-ii} (\href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FjxwkHFbNDM84nuqg513gR_0vIVql-evoT1EMiqSYZU/edit?pli=1&gid=97270185#gid=97270185}{Table S2}). All three papers used the Empatica E4 wristband device for real-time data acquisition; however, the selected modalities for training and analysis differed among the papers.
