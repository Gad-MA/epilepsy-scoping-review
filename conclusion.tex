\section{Conclusion}
Non-EEG seizure detection and prediction hold great promise for improving the quality of life of people with epilepsy. Combining EDA with motion sensors such as ACC, sEMG, and GYR has proven to be a reliable approach for seizure detection, while PPG data has emerged as a primary seizure predictor. Several advancements have been made in the field of seizure detection, though more outpatient validation is required for clinical implementation. 

On the other hand, a clear research gap is present in the field of seizure prediction and forecasting. More work is needed to establish reliable peri-ictal biomarkers, validate algorithms across diverse populations, and translate prediction models into practical, patient-centered applications. 

In this review, we presented, assessed and compared seizure detection and prediction/forecasting studies, highlighting the most promising sensor combinations and algorithmic approaches while also identifying current limitations.
